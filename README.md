# BigRedMatch

## Inspiration

This semester, many CS courses introduced the randomized partner matching system. It introduces
quite a bit of chaos and results in many very unsatisfactory partnership experience.

We believe randomization does not solve the problem. There should be a much better system that just
blames unluckness during randomization. We built such a system to demonstrate that there exists a
better alternative and we welcome cooperations.

## What it Does

The user registers, and tells us some of his/her information:

- Basic Profile Information
- Skills, introduction, experience
- Free Times
- Past, current, and future courses. The user can also tell us their grade and whether they become
  TA for those courses.

Then the user can select a course, find a list of all potential partners sorted in decreasing
quality. The user can send invite and form partnership on our platform.
