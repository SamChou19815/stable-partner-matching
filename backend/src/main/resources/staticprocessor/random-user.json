It teaches abstractions, design, and implementation techniques that allow students to build the kind of scalable high performance systems and networks that can deal with real-world cloud workloads. Students study high performance designs and implementations: They  create projects related to operating systems kernel and driver designs and implementations on the systems side and network medium, protocol, and topology designs on the networking side. The key is that students immerse themselves in state-of-the-art systems and networks, produce a few small course projects and a final project, and gain an understanding necessary to build highly available, reliable, and performant systems and networks while relying mainly on low cost, commodity components.","weightVector":{"projects":0.013785142451524734,"modeling":0,"software":0,"functions":0,"reasoning":0,"program":0,"discussion":0,"robot":0,"evaluation":0,"java":0,"problem":0,"optimization":0,"games":0,"context":0,"understanding":0.007629225496202707,"model":0,"text":0,"proof":0,"state":0,"knowledge":0,"hardware":0,"algorithm":0,"models":0,"goal":0,"devices":0,"testing":0,"foundations":0,"analysis":0,"intelligence":0,"planning":0,"system":0,"proofs":0,"processing":0,"programs":0,"theory":0,"algorithms":0,"logics":0,"robotics":0,"networks":0.00863752979785204,"computer":0,"search":0,"systems":0.01232999563217163,"web":0,"architecture":0,"side":0,"languages":0,"decision":0,"structures":0,"health":0,"computation":0,"consensus":0,"practicum":0,"machine":0,"information":0,"logic":0,"data":0,"project":0.009519217535853386,"language":0,"networking":0,"graphics":0,"experience":0,"research":0,"cloud":0.018503058701753616,"robots":0,"protocols":0,"programming":0,"computational":0,"development":0,"cryptography":0,"engineering":0,"graph":0,"technologies":0,"vision":0,"techniques":0,"principles":0,"problems":0,"game":0,"memory":0,"code":0,"challenges":0,"aspects":0,"privacy":0,"quantum":0,"papers":0,"network":0.01638164557516575,"computing":0,"security":0,"database":0,"design":0.014660811051726341,"studies":0,"human":0,"class":0,"implementation":0,"mobile":0,"lectures":0,"control":0,"technology":0,"artificial":0,"performance":0,"application":0,"management":0,"interaction":0,"user":0,"applications":0}},{"subject":"CS","code":"5414","title":"Distributed Computing Principles","description":"Studies the abstractions and algorithms that constitute the foundations for implementing concurrent and distributed computing, with emphasis on supporting fault-tolerance.
